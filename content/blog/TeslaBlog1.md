Since the beginning of 2019, Tesla (TSLA) has declined by nearly 50%, dropping from about $347 at its peak to $186. This enormous fluctuation in the value of the Tesla business has no seeming reason. 

Tesla split investors into the buyers who nothing less than envy Elon Musk's vision and short sellers who worry about the financial troubles Tesla faces. The short sellers have driven the price down significantly in this last run due to the large debt Tesla faces.

#### The Wall Street Perspective

Let's begin with Wall Street's perspective on Tesla by taking a look at analyst predictions for 2020. 28 Analysts estimate a year ago EPS of -1.17 USD, yet an increased sales growth of 23.5%. 2019 sales growth year/est is 16.10% which is already very high. The Tesla EPS as of 3/30/2019 was expected to be -0.69, but was realized to be -2.9, a -320% surprise. This upset had actually worsened from the 12/30/2018 EPS reporting a difference of -0.27, a surprise of -12%. Thus the massive short sell does not have root in revenue, but is correlated with EPS. This will come back into the fold when looking further into the financials below.

#### Share Price

26 analysts average a price target of 283.32 with a high of 437 and a low of 150. Tesla's stock price penetrates well into the lower portion of the range, coming in at 185.16.
