#### A Brief History of Decentralization

The blockchain can be described as a step along the journey to complete
decentralization. Some time ago, people - and possibly you yourself -
referenced information using the Encyclopedia Britannica and other
physical books. These reference books were built by a select number of
contributors who were paid by the different book publishers. Well, in
2001 the Wikipedia team was born to provide people with a free online
encyclopedia. As access to the internet grew and became more easily
accessible, this innovation spread. As of June, 2019, the number of
active English contributors (within the last 30 days) is 127,026.

In 2009, the financial crisis occurred in the United States and many
lost faith in the banks. This allowed the launch of a new project called
Bitcoin.

#### Bitcoin and the Decentralized Ledger

Now, to fully understand the roots of Bitcoin, we must first take a look
at a ledger. A ledger is simply a record of cash flowing in and out of
your balance, and everyone else's. In a centralized service such as
Paypal, we trust the Paypal team to record how much money everyone has.
But, in a decentralized ledger, there are thousands of computers around
the world competing to modify the ledger. When one computer attempts to
post a block of transactions to the ledger, the other computers verify
the transaction. The block is then posted to the ledger if more than 50%
of the computers agree that the transactions are correct. To see this in
action, we can go to https://blockchain.info to view
the latest transactions being verified by computers around the world.

On https://blockchain.info, we
can even click on a block to view many of its attributes, such as number
of transactions, output total, and the transaction fees. An example of
this is shown below.

So, Bitcoin is a decentralized network allowing users to transact peer
to peer without the middle man (such as a bank). Trust in the network is
created by having many computers from around the world agree on each
transaction. Unlike traditional currencies and assets, bitcoin is very
portable.

In fact, the idea of a decentralized ledger has intrigued the financial
industry and the banks themselves. The correspondent banking system that
slows banking transactions may soon be gone once all banks use one
decentralized ledger instead of each maintaining their own and verifying
the transactions with each other.

#### Blockchain

This whole time, we have been looking into Bitcoin and its decentralized
ledger that emerged in the wake of the 2009 financial crisis. Bitcoin
implements the blockchain to record transactions in a ledger. But it is
important to separate the idea of blockchain from Bitcoin as Bitcoin is
a cryptocurrency that uses the blockchain to record transactions.

The blockchain technology was actually first outlined in 1991 by Stuart
Haber and W. Scott Stornetta who wanted to create a system of
record-keeping where time stamps could not be tampered with. It was only
in 2009, when Satoshi Nakamoto utilized this technology in its first
real-world application called Bitcoin.

The takeaway of this blog is that the principle behind blockchain is
trust.
