Hello! I am Andreas Bigger, an undergraduate Viterbi Fellow at the University of Southern California majoring in computer science.

I am an avid web developer with machine learning/quantitative finance ambitions combined with an entrepreneurial flair. Through research at the USC Integrated Media Systems Center and Director of Engineering at HackSC, I am expanding my engineering and leadership experience.Complementing academics, I swim, play ice hockey, kiteboard, and ski. 

This blog tracks my adventures as I navigate computer science, quantitative finance, and all the other crazy experiments denting our universe.
