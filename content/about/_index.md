Hello! My name is Andreas Bigger and I am an undergraduate Viterbi Fellow at the University of Southern California majoring in computer science. I began my freshman year in August, 2018, and prior to this I studied at Cold Spring Harbor High School.

I am an avid web developer, who entered USC with basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. Fortunately, I dove into web development research and quickly obtained certificates from Programming with Mosh in React and NodeJS.

On the side of computer science, I am a swimmer, ice hockey player, kiteboarder, and amature photographer. On my blog I write about photography to push myself to learn, as well as investing and various ad hoc computer science interests.
